                Sonar Escape is an underwater treasure hunting game that focuses on exploration and discovery through the use of visual and auditory cues. The objective of the game is to explore the deep waters of the Indian Ocean, collect necessary tools along the way, and ultimately uncover the lost treasure of the Flor de la Mar. Players embark on a journey through the mysterious underwater world, guided by various visual and audio signals, as they seek to find the hidden treasure deep beneath the ocean's surface.

                The project was a collaborative effort between students from the Computer Science and Music departments at the University of Toronto, conducted over the course of one semester, approximately three months. It brought together students from diverse fields to develop a creative and original game. I contributed 20% to the design work for this project.
                <br/><br/>
                Specifically, I was responsible for the overall concept design of the game, including the user experience-focused design of the login screen. Additionally, I designed key 3D objects within the game, such as fish, sharks, and gems, which players interact with throughout the gameplay. The project is a successful example of how academic collaboration and creative design can come together, demonstrating how knowledge and skills from various fields can be integrated to achieve a unified goal.
